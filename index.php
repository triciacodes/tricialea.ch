      <p>Hi there! I'm <span class="branding">Tricia Leach</span>, a front-end web developer with a recent design education, and a professional background including project management. I love the process of collaborating with designers and clients, and take pride in caring about the small design details.
      </p>
      <p>I'm eager to learn new technologies, with a particular interest in creative development and animation. <!-- I previously worked at <a href="http://fuzzco.com/">Fuzzco</a> as a junior developer.--> I'm currently seeking a full-time role on a team with stellar collaboration in Portland, OR.

        This Shopify site was my first opportunity to be in a lead development role at Fuzzco. I developed reusable components, allowing the client to easily change design variations with toggles in Shopify admin. In parallel with this project, I contributed to a Shopify template that would allow our team to reduce development time for future e-commerce projects.

        <p>
        An e-commerce site that extends the typical functionality of Shopify to allow the client to add custom content through Accentuate Custom Fields, and build unique and flexible shop collections. I enjoyed working closely with the client to customize sections, and tweak design elements to ensure the final product matched her design.

        In collaboration with then Development Director at Fuzzco, <a target="_blank" href="http://nikolas.ws/">Nikolas Wise</a>, I worked on site architecture and built fields in Wordpress with Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields. I used a PHP templating language (Timber/Twig) to build the pages, and collaborated with Nikolas on styling the site with SASS/SCSS.

        <!-- <h3>Obligatory third person bio</h3> -->
        <p>I'm happiest working somewhere in the middle of design, art, craft, and technology. I love digging into the details of code to build engaging and delightful experiences, both for the web and the physical world. My secret weapons are my enthusiasm for community building, and a well-crafted spreadsheet.</p>
        <!-- <p>I have eight years of financial analysis/project management experience preceeding my years at Portland State. During that time I acquired many skills (<a href="/assets/tricia-leach-resume-dec-2017-web.pdf">pdf resume</a>) that complement the work I've been doing with programming. So while I may be looking for a junior dev position, I'll be bringing over a decade of professional experience with me, as well as a keen eye for design. -->
