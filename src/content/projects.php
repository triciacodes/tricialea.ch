    <p>
    This Shopify site was my first opportunity to be in a lead development role at Fuzzco. I developed reusable components, allowing the client to easily change design variations with toggles in Shopify admin. In parallel with this project, I contributed to a Shopify template that would allow our team to reduce development time for future e-commerce projects.

    <p>
    An e-commerce site that extends the typical functionality of Shopify to allow the client to add custom content through Accentuate Custom Fields, and build unique and flexible shop collections. I enjoyed working closely with the client to customize sections, and tweak design elements to ensure the final product matched her design.

    <p>
    In collaboration with then Development Director at Fuzzco, <a target="_blank" href="http://nikolas.ws/">Nikolas Wise</a>, I worked on site architecture and built fields in Wordpress with Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields. I used a PHP templating language (Timber/Twig) to build the pages, and collaborated with Nikolas on styling the site with SASS/SCSS.
