<h2>A little about me</h2>
<div class="c-about  box-flex">

  <div class="box-half  marg-r">
    <!-- <h3>Obligatory third person bio</h3> -->
    <p>I'm happiest working somewhere in the middle of design, art, craft, and technology. I love digging into the details of code to build engaging and delightful experiences, both for the web and the physical world. My secret weapons are my enthusiasm for community building, and a well-crafted spreadsheet.</p>
    <!-- <p>I have eight years of financial analysis/project management experience preceeding my years at Portland State. During that time I acquired many skills (<a href="/assets/tricia-leach-resume-dec-2017-web.pdf">pdf resume</a>) that complement the work I've been doing with programming. So while I may be looking for a junior dev position, I'll be bringing over a decade of professional experience with me, as well as a keen eye for design. -->
