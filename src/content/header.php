    <p>Hi there! I'm <span class="branding">Tricia Leach</span>, a front-end web developer with a recent design education, and a professional background including project management. I love the process of collaborating with designers and clients, and take pride in caring about the small design details.
    </p>
    <p>I'm eager to learn new technologies, with a particular interest in creative development. My previous experience includes a year working with the fine folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://fuzzco.com/">Fuzzco</a>. I'm currently seeking a full-time role in Portland, OR.
    <!-- You can also find me compiling some of my Processing and web animation experiments at my <a href="http://tricia.codes">code sketchbook</a>. -->
