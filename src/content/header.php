    <p>Hi there! I'm <span class="branding">Tricia Leach</span>, a front-end web developer with a recent design education, and a professional background including project management. I love the process of collaborating with designers and clients, and take pride in caring about the design details.
    </p>
    <p>I'm excited to be starting a new role on April 15th, and in the meantime I'm volunteering for <a target="_blank" href="http://designportland.org">Design Portland's</a> festival starting on April 6th.
    <!-- You can also find me compiling some of my Processing and web animation experiments at my <a href="http://tricia.codes">code sketchbook</a>. -->
